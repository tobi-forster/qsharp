      "**Uniform independent logical noise.** We assume that the error rate of a logical operation is approximately equal to its space-time volume (the number of tiles multiplied by the number of logical time steps) multiplied by the error rate of a logical qubit in a standard one-tile patch in one logical time step.",
      "**Negligible Clifford costs for synthesis.** We assume that the space overhead for synthesis and space and time overhead for transport of magic states within magic state factories and to synthesis qubits are all negligible.",
      "**Smooth magic state consumption rate.** We assume that the rate of T state consumption throughout the compiled algorithm is almost constant, or can be made almost constant without significantly increasing the number of logical time steps for the algorithm."

Its value must be between 0 and 1 and the default value is 0.001, which corresponds to 0.1%, and means that the algorithm is allowed to fail once in 1000 executions.  This parameter is highly application specific. For example, if one is running Shor's algorithm for factoring integers, a large value for the error budget may be tolerated as one can check that the output are indeed the prime factors of the input.  On the other hand, a much smaller error budget may be needed for an algorithm solving a problem with a solution which cannot be efficiently verified.  This budget $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_{\\log} + \\epsilon_{\\rm dis} + \\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ is uniformly distributed and applies to errors $\\epsilon_{\\log}$ to implement logical qubits, an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ to produce T states through distillation, and an error budget $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ to synthesize rotation gates with arbitrary angles.  Note that for distillation and rotation synthesis, the respective error budgets $\\epsilon_{\\rm dis}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\rm syn}$ are uniformly distributed among all T states and all rotation gates, respectively. If there are no rotation gates in the input algorithm, the error budget is uniformly distributed to logical errors and T state errors.",
