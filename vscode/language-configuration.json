  // This is the default word pattern from https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-configuration-guide
  // with the following modifications:
  //   @foo - Attributes, including the leading '@', are treated as one word.
  //   foo.bar - Qualified names, including the dots, are treated as one word.
  //
  // This setting influences how completions are committed when a partial word has been typed.
  // Some completions contain non-word characters (e.g. '@' and '.'), and when these completions are
  // committed, they must replace the entire word that has been typed until the cursor, including any special
  // characters.
  //
  // If you change this word pattern, please verify that Monaco and VS Code completions are working as intended
  // for attributes and namespaces, by explicitly invoking completions after typing '@', '@Entr', 'Microsoft.Q', etc.
  //
  // This setting is duplicated for the Monaco setting for the playground: playground/src/main.tsx
