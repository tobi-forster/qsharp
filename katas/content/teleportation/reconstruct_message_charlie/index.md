Alice has a message qubit in the state $\ket{\psi}$ to be teleported. She entangled it with her own qubit from $\ket{\Psi^{3}}$ in the same manner as in the `SendMessage` exercise and extracted two classical bits in order to send them to Charlie. Bob also measured his own qubit from $\ket{\Psi^{3}}$ and sent Charlie the result. Transform Charlie's qubit into the required state using the two classical bits received from Alice, and the one classical bit received from Bob.

**Inputs:** 
1. Charlie's part of the entangled trio of qubits `qCharlie`.
2. The tuple of classical bits received from Alice, in the format used in `SendMessage` exercise.
3. A classical bit resulting from the measurement of Bob's qubit.

**Goal:** 
Transform Charlie's qubit `qCharlie` into the state in which the message qubit had been originally.
